# DummyCSV

DummyCSV - it`s a fake CSV datasets generator with schemas customization, complex column types 
and fast operations with large files. Uses Swagger UI for live interaction with REST API endpoints
and celery for background tasks.

Swagger UI available on `api/docs/`. Credentials: `admin` / `admin`.

A Dataset with shapes 100000 x 10 and size ~100 MB was generated by ~10s and downloaded by ~14s. 

## Usage

* CSV schemas can be created, viewed and edited via `schemas` namespace endpoints.
* Creating sets triggers file generation.
* Generated files (set has `processed=true` flag) can be downloaded by `/sets/{id}/` endpoint.

Note: already generated files can be removed by heroku cycling or dyno restarting.
